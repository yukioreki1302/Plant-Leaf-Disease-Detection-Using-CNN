Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN (4/2024 - 6/2024)

Project: Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN (1 member)

Description: Develop an AI algorithm to detect and identify plant leaf
disease using image processing and deep learning techniques to assist
agricultural researchers and farmers in early disease detection and
management.

Technologies: CNN, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, TensorFlow/Keras.

Responsibilities: I am involved in the project from the ideation phase,
analysis, and processing of data, building CNN algorithms to train AI
models for disease recognition, identifying affected areas on leaves,
tracking the progression of diseases, analyzing patterns, and drawing
conclusions.
